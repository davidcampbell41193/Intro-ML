An in depth understand of how decision tree classifiers can be implimented in python using object oriented programming using the jupyter notebook, on GitHub, below.<br>

The goal of the project was to eveluate the performance of the "entropy" and "gini index" criterion both supported by the decission tree classifiers in the sklearn python package. The model was verified using two different metrics: (1) Mean Absolute Error and (2) Mean Squared Error.
